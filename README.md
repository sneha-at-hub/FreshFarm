# Node.js and React Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up Node.js and create a new React application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes npm, the Node.js package manager)

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. Download the Node.js installer from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
3. Verify the installation by running the following commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

    You should see the version numbers of Node.js and npm.

### Step 2: Create a React Application

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your React application.
2. Run the following command to create a new React application:

    ```bash
    npx create-react-app farm-web
    ```



3. Navigate into the newly created project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the React application, and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
